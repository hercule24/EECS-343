Cleanup pending requests:
Create a cleanup thread and initialize the seats’ states to be AVAILABLE at first. Then,
after every 5 seconds, check each seat’s status and update accordingly. If one seat was Pending before with the same user id, and it is still Pending after 5 seconds, then we 
set the state to be AVAILABLE.
