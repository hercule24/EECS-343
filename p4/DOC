Basic idea for this project is to go through the specification and ext2fs.h
to understand the structure of the ext2 file system. Understanding the
structure of the super block and its fixed location will help to solve the
first two functions. And the third one is trivial, because every block can 
be indexed like an array element in the file system. Knowing that the block
group descriptor is always the next block of the super block will help solve
the fourth function. For the fifth function, we can get the address of the 
inode_table from the block group descriptor. Because the content of a directory
indoe is an array of directory entries, by iterating over the entries, and compare
the name of target file/directories to the entries name, we can find the desired
file eventually. For the extra credit, the first indirect node's number is stored
as the 13th element in the i_block of the inode of the file. After we get the
address of the indirect node' block, since this block consists of the node ids 
where the data is actually stored, we can go though this block to get all the blocks
storing the data.
